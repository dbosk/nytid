\chapter{A command-line interface}

In this chapter we document the command-line interface, \ie the command 
[[pytid]].

The command has a subcommand-based design, similar to commands like [[git]].
In this chapter we cover how we handle the subcommands and give the [[config]] 
subcommand as an example.
Other subcommands are given their own chapters.
