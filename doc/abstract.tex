We provide a library and command-line interface to manage TA bookings for 
teaching sessions.

The library can parse ICS calendars containing the course schedule, generate a
sign-up sheet for TAs, later parse that sign-up sheet (directly from a Google
Sheets URL) to compute employment data for amanuensis or time sheets for hourly
employed TAs, among other things.

The schedule view integrates course events, external calendars, and pending
tasks, automatically scheduling work items into free time slots to give a
complete picture of upcoming commitments.

It also provides time tracking, task management with GitHub integration, and
the ability to delegate tasks to AI agents for autonomous processing.
