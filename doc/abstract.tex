We provide a library and command-line interface to manage TA bookings for 
teaching sessions.

The library can parse ICS calendars containing the course schedule, generate a
sign-up sheet for TAs, later parse that sign-up sheet (directly from a Google
Sheets URL) to compute employment data for amanuensis or time sheets for hourly
employed TAs, among other things.
It also provides time tracking, task management, and the ability to delegate
tasks to AI agents for autonomous processing.
